This PowerShell profile script automatically fetches and loads a **centralized PowerShell profile** from GitHub every time a new session starts. It allows you to centrally manage and update your PowerShell environment across multiple machines by simply updating the profile in your GitHub repo.

---

## 📄 Purpose

- ✅ Load a **remote PowerShell profile** dynamically from GitHub  
- 🔄 Keep your environment **up-to-date** with the latest changes  
- 💥 Eliminate the need to manually sync or copy profile scripts  
- 🛠 Gracefully handle errors if the remote script is unavailable

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This script:
1. Defines a GitHub URL pointing to your remote `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
2. Downloads the file to the local temp directory.
3. Executes the script in the current PowerShell session.
4. Prints success or failure messages accordingly.

## 🔧 GitHub Source Reference

```powershell
$remoteProfile = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigjoestretch/public/refs/heads/main/PowerShell/PowerShell%20Profile/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1'
```

> 🔁 Update this URL if you move or rename your GitHub repo.

---

## 🛡️ Failsafe Behavior

If the remote script fails to load (e.g., due to no internet), the session will continue without breaking, and a warning will be shown:

```powershell
Write-Warning "⚠ Failed to load remote profile: $_"
```

## ✨ Benefits

- Central management of PowerShell profiles
