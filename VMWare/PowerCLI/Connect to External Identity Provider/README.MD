# Connect to External Identity Provider

If your vCenter Server is configured with an external identity provider, such as Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or other external identity provider supported by VMware Identity Service, you can authenticate with PowerCLI by using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type.

The PowerCLI scripts in this repository allow you to authenticate with PowerCLI using one of the external identity prpoviders.
