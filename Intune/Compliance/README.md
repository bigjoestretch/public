# Custom compliance discovery scripts for Microsoft Intune

This repository contains a collection of cusomized Microsoft Intune Custom Compliance scripts

Before you can use custom settings for compliance with Microsoft Intune, you must define a script that can discover the custom compliance settings that are available on devices.

The discovery script deploys to devices as part of your custom compliance policies. When compliance runs on a device, the script discovers the settings that are defined by the JSON file that you also provide through custom compliance policy.

## The Intune Custom Compliance Policy Repository

This repository contains detection/discovery scripts and JSON files for Microsoft Intune *Custom* comppliance scripts and policies. Each Custom compliance contains the following artifacts.

| Artifact | Description |
| ---------|-------------|
| README.md | Description of the custom compliance with references to the detection script and compliance validation JSON file |
| Detect-.ps | PowerShell detection script |
| Detect-.json |  a JSON file that identifies the settings and value pairs that you want to use for custom compliance.|

## Microsoft Intune custom compliance policies

Microsoft Intune [custom compliance policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/compliance-use-custom-settings) allow organizations to define specific requirements and conditions that devices must meet to be considered compliant with organizational standards. These policies enable administrators to tailor compliance checks based on unique business needs and security requirements.

## Microsoft Intune custom compliance configuration

### Upload the detection script

1. Sign into Microsoft Intune admin center and go to Endpoint security > Device compliance > Scripts > Add > (choose your platform).
2. On Basics, provide a Name.
3. On Settings, add your script to Detection script. Review your script carefully. Intune doesn’t validate the script for syntax or programmatic errors.
4. For Windows only - On Settings, configure the following behavior for the PowerShell script:
    - Run this script using the logged on credentials – By default, the script runs in the System context on the device. Set this value to Yes to have it run in the context of the logged-on user. If the user isn’t logged in, the script defaults back to the System context.
    - Enforce script signature check – For more information, see about_Signing in the PowerShell documentation.
    - Run script in 64 bit PowerShell Host – By default, the script runs using the 32-bit PowerShell host. Set this value to Yes to force the script to run using the 64-bit host instead.
5. Complete the script creation process. The script is now visible in the Scripts pane of the Microsoft Intune admin center and is available to select when configuring compliance policies.

    c. For Upload and validate the JSON file with your custom compliance settings, select the folder icon and then locate and add the JSON file for Windows that you want to use with this policy.
6. On the Actions for noncompliance tab, specify a sequence of actions to apply automatically to devices that don't meet this compliance policy.

Now wait for the Compliance policy to be processed on the client. Run the following command on a device that has the policy assigned to enforece the Intune policy synch.

```powershell
# Trigger Intune Synch
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Intune Management Extension\Microsoft.Management.Services.IntuneWindowsAgent.exe" -ArgumentList intunemanagementextension://synccompliance
```
